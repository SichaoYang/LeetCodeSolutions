# LeetCode 1589. Maximum Sum Obtained of Any Permutation: Solution
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-obtained-of-any-permutation/
## Approach: Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation
### Intuition
The total sum of all requests is essentially the weighted sum of ``nums``, 
where the weight for each element is its requested frequency. 
Therefore, the maximum total sum is reached when we assign larger values to indices with higher frequencies.
The problem thus transforms into counting the requested frequency of each index.
Brute force counting yields a time complexity of ``O(nums.length * requests.length)``, 
but intuitively we can optimize it by counting overlapping intervals among multiple requests
as an entire whole, instead of individual indices.

### Algorithm
A proper data structure for interval (segment) operations, a **segment tree**, is formed by 
dividing an interval (root node) into subintervals (child nodes), and subintervals into subsubintervals, interatively,
such that operations on an entire interval can be buffered in the corresponding interval node, saving computation time. 
A concrete walkthrough below illustrates the segment tree algorithms related to this specific problem.
For a more general introduction, see [here](https://leetcode.com/articles/a-recursive-approach-to-segment-trees-range-sum-queries-lazy-propagation/).

#### Build the segment tree
For implementational convenience, we build a binary tree and store it in array ``tree``. 
There are two common ways of doing so:
- Store the root at ``tree[0]``.
- The children of ``tree[i]`` are stored at ``tree[2*i+1]`` and ``tree[2*i+2]``.

or 

- Store the root at ``tree[1]``, leaving ``tree[0]`` unused.
- The children of ``tree[i]`` are stored at ``tree[2*i]`` and ``tree[2*i+1]``.

This solution adopts the latter. =====Nov 10=====.
